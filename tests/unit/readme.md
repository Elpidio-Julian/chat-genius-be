# Unit Tests Documentation

Unit tests are focused on testing individual components or functions in isolation from the rest of the system. They verify that each unit of code works correctly on its own by testing specific inputs and expected outputs.

## Purpose of Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Verify edge cases and error handling
- Ensure code behaves as expected at a granular level
- Catch bugs early in development
- Act as documentation for how code should behave
- Enable safe refactoring by catching regressions
