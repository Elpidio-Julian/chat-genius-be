# Integration Tests Documentation

Integration tests verify that different components of the application work together correctly. Unlike unit tests that test components in isolation, integration tests examine how multiple parts interact as a system.

## Purpose of Integration Tests

- Test interactions between multiple components
- Verify end-to-end workflows and business processes
- Ensure data flows correctly through the system
- Test external dependencies and integrations
- Catch integration issues early
- Validate system behavior at a higher level

## Integration Test Structure for this Project

For this Node.js/Express API project, integration tests would focus on:

### API Endpoint Testing
- Test complete HTTP request/response cycles
- Verify proper data persistence in database
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Validate request validation and error handling
- Test API versioning and routing

### Database Integration
- Test database transactions and rollbacks
- Verify data integrity across tables
- Test database connection pooling
- Validate database migrations
- Test database error scenarios

### External Service Integration
- Test third-party API integrations
- Verify webhook handling
- Test file storage operations
- Validate email sending
- Test payment processing

### Example Test Structure:

```javascript
describe('API Endpoint Integration', () => {
  it('should create a new user and return 201 status', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).post('/api/users').send({
      clerk_id: 'test_clerk_123',
      email: 'test@example.com',
      full_name: 'Test User'
    });
  });
});
```
